        <h3>History was made this summer <small class="text-muted d-block">The first arrest made on facial recognition
                evidence alone</small></h3>
        <p>In June 2020, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/882683463/the-computer-got-it-wrong-how-facial-recognition-led-to-a-false-arrest-in-michig" target="blank">first arrest</a> using only evidence from Facial Recognition (FR) technology occurred
            in Detroit, Michigan. Once the software gave police a potential perpetrator, a black man, officers arrested him without any other investigating. The man was arrested in his front yard without any questioning and without being given information
            about what was happening while his family and neighbors watched. He was detained for 30 hours and was eventually released on bail until his court hearing. The charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence. However, a person was still
            wrongfully accused of and arrested for a crime based on erroneous but confident false identification from security footage analysis. </p>

        <p>This software, although facing critique, is still presently being used in Detroit.</p>
