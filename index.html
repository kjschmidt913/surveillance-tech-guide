        <h3>History was made this summer <small class="text-muted d-block">The first arrest made on facial recognition
                evidence alone</small></h3>
        <p>In June 2020, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/882683463/the-computer-got-it-wrong-how-facial-recognition-led-to-a-false-arrest-in-michig" target="blank">first arrest</a> using only evidence from Facial Recognition (FR) technology occurred
            in Detroit, Michigan. Once the software gave police a potential perpetrator, a black man, officers arrested him without any other investigating. The man was arrested in his front yard without any questioning and without being given information
            about what was happening while his family and neighbors watched. He was detained for 30 hours and was eventually released on bail until his court hearing. The charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence. However, a person was still
            wrongfully accused of and arrested for a crime based on erroneous but confident false identification from security footage analysis. </p>
        <!-- need to shortly review what the crime was so we can say this technology looked at security footage before i just throw that in at the end -->

        <p>This software, although facing critique, is still presently being used in Detroit.</p>

        <h3>How could this wrongful arrest happen? <small class="text-muted d-block">Surveillance technology.</small>
        </h3>
        <p>Surveillance technology takes many forms- </p>
        <!-- need a lil something about this tech generally. just like 3 sentences as an intro -->
        <h4>Project Green Light</h4>
        <p>Project Green Light, a community policing effort in the city of Detroit, Michigan. Cameras are installed throughout the city at designated locations and have a direct feed to the Detroit Police. This system has been marketed to the citizens of
            Detroit as a way to prevent crime.</p>
        <p>Project Green Light partners with local businesses to set up cameras at their locations with accompanying Project Green Light signs. The cameras allow the Detroit Police Department to have a live stream of the city from many different viewpoints,
            and in turn, offer the businesses extra support from the police and a potential crime deterrent with the branded sign. Police “virtually patrol” each affiliated location once a day and physically patrol around 184 affiliated locations each
            day </p>
        <h4>Facial Recognition Technology</h4>
        <p>FR technology is a part of Project Green Light. The project uses a database containing 8 million criminal images and 32 million DMV images. Almost every resident of Michigan is represented in this database. <b>You are likely represented in a database just like this without your knowledge and consent.</b>
        </p>
        <p>There are no standards that FR technology has to meet to be released on the market. This means that this technology can identify people with an accuracy of less that 20% and still be considered a reliable tool for law enforcement. In fact, this
            is what's actually happening.</p>
        <p>These systems especially fail at correctly identifying people of color, and specifically Black people, which is not ideal in a city whose population is approximately 80% Black. The FR technology is likely to misidentify the majority of people
            whose images are captured in the Project Green Light surveillance footage leading to false charges and arrests, making people of color in Detroit most affected by this technology.</p>

        <h3>This is happening in Detroit. How does it affect me?</h3>
        <p>Surveillance technology is actually being implemented all over the country with very little publicity or oversight. While complete statistics have proven difficult to come by, there are examples of cities in <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/here-are-79-policies-california-surveillance-tech-where-are-other-90"

                target="blank">Illinois</a>, Massachusetts</p>
        <p>This technology is spreading rapidly and there isn’t much resistance.</p>

        <h3>Is there any legal protection against surveillance tech?</h3>
        <p>While there are no regulations or user protections on the federal level, a few states are taking action to protect their citizens. </p>

        <h3>What can I do as a regular citizen to protect my community?</h3>
