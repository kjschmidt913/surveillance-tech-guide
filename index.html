        <h3>History was made this summer <small class="text-muted d-block">The first arrest made on facial recognition
                evidence alone</small></h3>
        <div class="row mt-3">
            <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
                <p>In June 2020, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/882683463/the-computer-got-it-wrong-how-facial-recognition-led-to-a-false-arrest-in-michig" target="blank">first arrest</a> using only evidence from Facial Recognition (FR) technology
                    occurred in Detroit, Michigan. Five watches were stolen from a Shinola store. The police reviewed security footage from the incident and zoomed in on the perpetrator to gather an image of him. They ran this image through the police
                    department's FR software, which gave police a potential suspect. Officers arrested him without any other investigating. The man was arrested in his front yard without questioning or being provided with any information about what was
                    happening as his family and neighbors stood by and watched. He was detained for 30 hours and was eventually released on bail until his court hearing.</p>
                <p>The man arrested lived 25 miles north of Detroit, had a solid alibi, and didn't own any of the clothing that the man in the security footage was wearing. Without the FR software's output stating he was a match, there were no indications
                    that he could have possibly commited this crime.
                </p>

            <div class="col-12 col-lg-6"><img class="img-fluid" src="images/wrongful_arrest_probe.png" /></div>
        </div>

        <p>The charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence. However, a person was still wrongfully accused of and arrested for a crime based on erroneous false identification from security footage analysis. While some may argue that FR technology
            is simply a tool used to aid police in finding leads, that explanation will not do in such an impactful and high stakes arena. The Michigan State Police's Investigative lead report, shown above, clearly states that the document contains a
            possible lead to be investigated, and that it is not probable cause for arrest. No matter how clearly stated, bold, underlined, etc. this guideline is, it was not followed.</p>

        <p>This software is still presently being used in Detroit.</p>

        <h3>How could this wrongful arrest happen? <small class="text-muted d-block">Surveillance technology.</small>
        </h3>
        <p>Surveillance technology takes many forms- </p>
        <!-- need a lil something about this tech generally. just like 3 sentences as an intro -->
        <h4>Project Green Light</h4>
        <p><a href="https://detroitmi.gov/departments/police-department/project-green-light-detroit" target="blank">Project Green Light</a>is a community policing effort in the city of Detroit, Michigan. Cameras are installed throughout the city at designated
            locations and have a direct feed to the Detroit Police. This system has been marketed to the citizens of Detroit as a way to prevent crime.</p>
        <p>Project Green Light partners with local businesses to set up cameras at their locations with accompanying Project Green Light signs. The cameras allow the Detroit Police Department to have a live stream of the city from many different viewpoints,
            and in turn, offer the businesses extra support from the police and a potential crime deterrent with the branded sign. Police <a href="http://video.detroitmi.gov/CablecastPublicSite/show/5963?channel=3." target="blank">“virtually patrol”</a>            each affiliated location once a day and physically patrol around <a href="https://detroitmi.gov/webapp/project-green-light-map" target="blank">184 affiliated locations</a> each day.</p>

        <h4>Facial Recognition Technology</h4>
        <p>FR technology is a part of Project Green Light. The project uses a database containing 8 million criminal images and 32 million DMV images. Almost every resident of Michigan is represented in this database. <b>You are likely represented in a database just like this without your knowledge and consent.</b>
        </p>
        <p>There are no standards that FR technology has to meet to be released on the market. This means that this technology can identify people with an accuracy of less that 20% and still be considered a reliable tool for law enforcement. In fact, this
            is what's actually happening.</p>
        <p>These systems especially fail at correctly identifying people of color, and specifically Black people, which is not ideal in a city whose population is approximately 80% Black. The FR technology is likely to misidentify the majority of people
            whose images are captured in the Project Green Light surveillance footage leading to false charges and arrests, making people of color in Detroit most affected by this technology.</p>

        <h3>This is happening in Detroit. How does it affect me?</h3>
        <p>Surveillance technology is actually being implemented all over the country with very little publicity or oversight. While complete statistics have proven difficult to come by, there are examples of cities in <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/here-are-79-policies-california-surveillance-tech-where-are-other-90"
                target="blank">California</a>, <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/policy/technology/nyc-force-nypd-reveal-its-secret-surveillance-tech.html" target="blank">New York</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagoreporter.com/high-tech-surveillance-amplifies-police-bias-and-overreach/"
                target="blank">Illinois</a>, Massachusetts</p>
        <p>This technology is spreading rapidly and there isn’t much resistance.</p>
